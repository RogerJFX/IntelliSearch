# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors 
and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community 
a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, 
ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, 
personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

We don't give a damned shit on anybody not being or becoming our friend. We are cool 
and we try to keep staying cool. 

That's all. 

So if you think you are cool, ok then...

**Any violation of our pledge (see above) will lead to a guess you are not a friend. 
Sorry in this particular case.**

## Scope

Better software. What else?
