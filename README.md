PhoneticSearch
-

This project is in a very early state (started in 2018, 21th of July). 
Yet it should appear to be a proof of concept. It was a weekend, and I had some beer, sorry.

It is written in Scala, version 2.12.6. The topic is a search engine using Lucene. 
The Lucene version is 7.4.0.

The idea is to at least find matches based on phonetic conditions prior to fuzzy matches.

Remember this: language is first spoken, then written. So a phonetic search in front of 
fuzzy does make sense. 

Final goal is to deduce reliable data out of fuzzy data. 

This approach only focuses on the German language so far. 

One last note: I initially wrote Scala code, that would have been easily
translated into Java. I lost this scope and I am sorry for this. However it still 
is possible, even if it meanwhile would be a real pain in my holy *beep*.
